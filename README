This program is one of the assignments of the computer network course I take.
Although it is not designed very well, It still works when the content of a 
mail is US-ASCII encoding. The whole effort was put in to base64 encoding and
SMTP protocol handling.

--FEATURES--

The base64 encoding part is designed to use very little memory, it encodes 
on-the-fly. Also, a stream wrapper is implemented to handle line-wrapping.

--WARRANTY--

There is absolutely no warranty for this program, and may be many bugs
unidentified.
